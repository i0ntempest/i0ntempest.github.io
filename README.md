More to be added<br />
All my packages are built with LZMA compression therefore can be installed on iOS 10-12<br />
Packages should work on iOS 10.x to 12.x unless explicitly stated in package description.<br />
However do note that I only have one jailbroken device running iOS 12.4 and packages are tested there.
