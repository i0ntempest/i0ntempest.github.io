Description: Just the ioreg command from the IOKit Tools. 32BIT ONLY.
	THIS PACKAGE IS 32BIT ONLY
	ioreg is missing from the IOKit package in the Electra repo. This package adds it back.
	For people using iOS 10 but have IOKit from Electra repo installed, this package can be very useful.
	If ioreg complains that libncurses.5.dylib is not loaded and you're on iOS 10 or earlier, try installing libncurses in my repo.

Description: Just the libncurses.5.dylib file from 32bit 5.7 version of New Curses
	Compatible with iOS 10 and earlier.
	ioreg depends on New Curses (ncurses). If the 32bit version of ioreg in my repo doesn't work and you have New Curses installed, then you most likely have installed the 64bit version. Install this 32bit version and you should be fine. The 64bit version of ioreg should work if you have 64bit version of New Curses installed.
	This package won't install if the file it contains already exists (/usr/lib/libncurses.5.dylib). In this case you should already have the 32bit version installed.

Description: Makes MTerminal sounds and looks better, especially on iPad Pro 12.9
	Makes MTerminal sounds and looks better, especially on iPad Pro 12.9.
	This package does 3 things:
	- Replaces the bell sound in MTerminal with the funk sound found in macOS
	- Replaces Info.plist to allow Landscape mode on iPad
	- Adds LaunchScreen storyboard to avoid a stretched icon being showed when launching, when some tweaks are enabled (like PerfectFit).
	All files this package replaces will be backed up.
	If you're using an iPad Pro, full size keyboard can be force enabled by using PerfitFit. It stretches the app to fit the screen on whatever device you have.
